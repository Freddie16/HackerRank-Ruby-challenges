1.BDD
-Group students into two categories corresponding to their marks obtained in the test.
-The list contains students in a hash with student name as key and marks as value.
-Use pass-marks as a parameter.
-The method must return a Hash containing an array of students who passed and those who failed.
-If the key is empty it should not return a key.
2.Pseudo-code
