=Begin
1.BDD
-Write a method that helps in temperature conversion.
-The method will receive a number as an input,a named parameter and an optional parameter on the output.
-It should return the converted temperature between celsius,Kelvin and fahrenheit scales.
2.Pseudo-code
start
-Create a method(convert_temp) taking two parameters(n and opt).
-Use case condition to iterate over statements that give different temperatures.
-Use when to give types to the case statement.
-Use another case condition for the output scale.
